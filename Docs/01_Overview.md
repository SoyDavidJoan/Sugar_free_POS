# Project Overview

## Project Name: Sugar Free POS

### Description

**Sugar Free POS** is a simple, cross-platform point-of-sale system designed for small and emerging businesses that only need basic store operations such as sales, product entries, and user control.  
It uses a local database and does not require an internet connection to work. 

By simplifying key processes and supporting multiple platforms, the system can be installed on a wide range of devices — from low-cost computers to mobile phones.  
This makes it accessible for small and micro businesses that need a simple way to manage inventory and sales operations without investing in expensive hardware or complex systems.

### Objectives

- Provide a very simple sales process.
- Manage product inventory efficiently.
- Support user management with roles (e.g., admin, cashier).

## Scope

The system is intended for small stores and emerging businesses.  
It will **not** include features such as:

- Advanced reports
- External API integrations
- Networking between multiple stores or devices
